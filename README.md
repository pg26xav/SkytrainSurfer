This is a class project that I took apart in where I did the UI programming,
and doing the Unity Game Services Leaderboards.


# Main Menu

Here we have the Main Menu that can directly take you into the game.

# Gameplay

In these two photos, you can see the ui in the top right corner. There is where I have made the pause button to pause (second photo) when you need to take that break or
if you want to go back into the Main Menu. Back in the first photo you see two numbers. The top number is the score. It shows you how far you have travelled and
how long you have survived! The bottom number is the coins. For the coins, for each coin you collet, it adds a point.


# Game Over and Leaderboards

In this photo, you can see your score from this playthrough, if you didn't play before, your current score will be placed into the leaderboard. From there your name will be highlighted yellow
and will be shown with other people who have played the game. If you have played the game before, and did not beat your high score, your score at the top will be shown for you,
but your high score will be kept up on the leaderboard.
