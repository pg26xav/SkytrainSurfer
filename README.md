# SkytrainSurfer
Made for mobile. This is a class project that I took apart in where I did the UI programming and doing the Unity Game Services Leaderboards.

# How to use
- Download the project and open it into Unity 2023.2.20f1. (There is no .exe file)
- Open up "XavTestGym" and hit play in editor.
- Use the mouse to click and drag to go left and right.
- If it doesn't work, go into editor and switch "Game" into "Simulation". From there, it should work.

- In these two photos, you can see the ui in the top right corner. 
- I have made the pause button to pause (second photo) or if you want to go back into the Main Menu. 
- In the first photo you see two numbers. The top number is the score. It shows you how far you have travelled and
how long you have survived!
- The bottom number is the coins. For the coins, for each coin you collet, it adds a point.


# Game Over and Leaderboards

- You can see your score at the top.
- If you never played before, your current score will be placed into the leaderboard.
- Your name will be highlighted yellow.
- Your score will be shown with other people who have played the game.
- If you have played the game before and did not beat your high score, your high score will be kept up on the leaderboard.
